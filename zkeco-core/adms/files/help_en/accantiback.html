  <h3>Anti-passback  settings</h3>
  Currently anti-passback settings support in and out  anti-passback. In some special occasions, it is required that the card holder  who entered from a door by card punching must exit from the same door by card  punching, with the entry and exit records strictly consistent. One who followed  another to enter the door without card punching will be denied when trying to  exit by card punching, and one who followed another to exit without card  punching will be denied when trying to enter by card punching. And when one who  entered by card punching gives the card to another to try entering, the other  person will be denied. The user can use this function just by enable it in the  settings. This function is normally used in prisons, the army, national  defense, scientific research, bank vaults, etc.<br />
