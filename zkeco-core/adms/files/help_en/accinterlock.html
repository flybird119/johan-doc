  <h3>Interlock settings</h3><br />
  Interlock can be set for any two or more lock belong to  one access control panel, so that when one door is opened, the others will be  closed. And you can open one door only when others are closed.<br /><br />
      <b>Add interlock settings:</b><br /><br />
    1. Click [Access Control] - [Door configuration] - [Interlock  settings] - [Add] to enter the interlock setting edit interface;<br /><br />
    2. Select device to show interlock settings. Since one  device can only correspond to one interlock setting record, when adding,  interlocked devices can not be seen in the dropdown list of the device. When  deleting established interlock information, the corresponding device will  return to the dropdown list. The setting page will vary with the number of  doors controlled by the selected device:<br /><br />
    A one-door control panel has no interlock settings;<br />
    A two-door control panel: 1-2 two-door interlock  settings;<br />
    A four-door control panel: 1-2 two-door interlock, 3-4  two-door interlock, 1-2-3 three-door interlock,  1-2-3-4 four-door interlock;<br />
  <div class="alignC"><img width="414" height="56" src="accinterlock_clip_image002.jpg" /></div><br /><br />
    3. Select interlock settings, tick an item (multiple  interlocks can be selected as long as doors are not repeated), click [OK] to  complete setting, and then the added interlock settings will be shown in the  list.<br />
    For example, select 1-2-3-4  four-door interlock, if you want open door 3, doors 1, 2 and 4 need to be  closed.<br />
  <br />
<b>Note: </b>When editing, the device  can not be modified, but the interlock setting can be modified. If interlock setting  is not required for the device any more, the interlock setting record can be  deleted. When deleting a device record, its interlock setting record, if exist,  will be deleted.
