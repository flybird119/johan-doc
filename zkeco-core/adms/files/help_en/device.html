  <h2>Device management</h2><br />

  Set the communication parameters of connected devices.  Only when communication parameters, including system settings and device  settings, are correct, normal communication with devices will be possible. When  communication is successful, you can view the information of connected devices,  and perform remote monitoring, uploading and downloading data.<br />
  <div class="zkeco">The system supports access control and attendance  system, so connecting devices includes add access control panel and add  attendance recorder. To add access control panel, search and view devices  connected to the network, and directly add from the searching result. For an  attendance device having ADMS function, just set in the device and then connect  to the network.

<h3> Add  access control panel </h3><br />

  There are two way to add access control panel. <br /><br />

      <b>1. Add device:</b><br /><br /></div>
<div class="zkeco">
    (1) Click [Device] - [Device] - [Add] to show the  device information edit interface. Select device type (access control panel)  and click Next:<br />
  <div class="alignC"><img width="262" height="90" src="device_clip_image002.jpg" /></div><br />
    <br />
(2) Select access control panel to show the device  information of device. The communication modes are TCP/ IP or RS485. The  following interface will be shown:<br />
  <br /></div>
  <div class="acc">(1) Click [Device] - [Device] - [Add] to show the device information edit interface. The communication modes are TCP/ IP or RS485. The following interface will be shown:</div>
<div class="zkecoacc"><b>TCP/ IP:</b><br /></div>
  <div class="alignC zkeco"><img width="568" height="19" src="device_clip_image004.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="alignC zkecoacc"><img width="568" height="246" src="device_clip_image004acc.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="zkecoacc">
  <b>IP address:</b> Please enter the IP address of the access control  panel;<br />
  <b>IP port No.:</b> In Ethernet mode, the default is 4370;<br /></div>
  <br />
<div class="zkecoacc"><b>RS485:</b><br /><br /></div>

  <div class="alignC zkeco"><img width="807" height="21" src="device_clip_image006.jpg" /></div>
  <div class="alignC zkecoacc"><img width="807" height="244" src="device_clip_image006acc.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
  <div class="zkecoacc">
  <b>Serial port number:</b> COM1-COM254;<br />
  <b>485 address: </b>The machine number. When serial port numbers are the same, there will be no repeated 485 addresses;<br />
  <b>Baud rate: </b>Same as the baud rate of the device (9600/  19200/ 38400/ 57600/115200). The default is 38400;<br />
  <b>Device name: </b>Any character, up to a combination of 20  characters;<br />
  <b>Communication password: </b>Up to a combination of 15 characters. You need to input this field only when you add a new device with  the communication password. It can’t be modify when you edit the device  information except in [Modify communication password] operation. Please refer  to 7.3.1 Door management. <br />
  <br /><b> </b><b>Note: </b>You need not input this  field if the device has no communication password, such as it is new factory  device or just after the initialization.<br /><br />

  <b>Panel type: </b>One-door panel, two-door panel, four-door  panel;<br />
  <b>Switch to two-door two-way: </b>When four-door panel is selected, this box  will appear. By default, it is not ticked. The parameter is used to switch the  four-door one-way access control panel to two-door two-way access control panel  (For changes of extended device parameters before and after switching, see  relevant files of access control panel).<br />
  <br /><b> </b><b>Note: </b>After the four door one-way  access control panel is switched to two- door two-way access control panel, to  switch back, you need delete the device from the system and add it again. When  adding, do not tick the check box before this parameter.<br /><br />

  <b>Auto synchronize device time:</b> By default it is ticked, namely, it will  synchronize device time with server time each time connecting the device. If it  is unchecked, the user can manually synchronize device time;<br />
  <br />
<b>Area: </b>Specify areas of devices. After area setting,  devices (doors) can be filtered by area upon real-time monitoring.<br />
    <span class="zkeco">(3)</span><span class="acc">(2)</span> After editing, click [OK], and the system will try  connecting the current device:<br />
    If connection is successful, it will read corresponding  extended parameters of the device. At this time, if the access control panel  type selected by the user does not meet the corresponding parameters of the  actual device, the system remind the user. If the user clicks [OK]to save, it  will save the actual access control panel type of the device;<br />
    Extended device parameters: Serial number, device type,  firmware version number, auxiliary input quantity, auxiliary output quantity,  door quantity, and reader quantity.<br />
    If device connection fails, while the user still needs  to add the device to the system, corresponding device parameters and extended  parameters, such as serial number, will not be written into the system, and  such settings as anti-passback and linkage will be impossible. These settings  can be created only when the device is reconnected successfully and  corresponding parameters are acquired.<br />
  <br />
<b>Access control panel settings:</b><br />

  <br /><b> TCP/  IP communication requirements:</b><br />
    Support and enable TCP/ IP communication, directly  connect the device with PC or connect to the Internet, get the device IP  address and other information of the device;<br />
  <br /><b> RS485  communication requirements:</b><br />
    Support and enable RS485 communication, connect to PC  through RS485, get the serial port number, RS485 machine number (address), baud  rate and other information of the device.<br /><br />

  <b>2. Add device by searching  access control panels:</b><br /><br />

    Search the access control panels in the Ethernet.<br />
    (1) Click [Device] - [Device] - [Search panels], to  show the search interface;<br />
    (2) Click [Start search], and it will prompt  [searching……];<br />
    (3) After searching, the list and total number of  access control panels will be displayed;<br />
  <div class="alignC"><img width="708" height="456" src="device_clip_image008.jpg" /></div>
  <br />
    (4) Click [Add to device list] behind the device, and  the browser may pop up a security tip. Right-click to select [Window  temporarily allowing script execution], click [Add to device list] behind the  device again, and a dialog box will pop up. Enter self-defined device name, and  click [OK] to complete device adding.<br />
    (5) The default IP address of the access control panel  may conflict with the IP of a device on the Internet. You can modify its IP  address: Click [Modify IP address] behind the device, and a dialog box will pop  up. Enter the new IP address and communication password (If the device has a  communication password, you must enter the correct communication password for  successful modification. otherwise, you need not to enter it), and click  [Confirm] to complete IP address modification;<br />
