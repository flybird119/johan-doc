  <h2>Area settings</a> </h2><br />

  Area is a spatial concept, facilitating the user to  manage devices in a specific area.<br />
  <br />
  <div class="att">
    In the attendance system, area settings specify areas  of devices. The area concept facilitates the system’s automatic management of  user name lists on devices. When different devices are set in one (multiple)  area(s), and personnel are assigned to one (multiple) area(s), the system will  automatically distribute these personnel to devices in real-time (from time to  time), without requiring the user to manually manage the user name lists on  devices each time. <br /></div>
	<div class="acc">
    <br />
    In the access system, after area setting, devices  (doors) can be filtered by area upon real-time monitoring.<br />
    <br /></div>
    The system, by default, has set an area named  [Headquarter] and numbered [1]. Area settings include add area and delete area.<br />
  <br />
<b>1. Add area:</b><br /><br />

    Click [Device] - [Area settings] - [Add] to activate  the add area edit interface:<br />
  <div class="alignC"><img width="244" height="117" src="area_clip_image002.jpg" /></div><br />
  <br />
<b>The fields are as follows:</b><br /><br />

  <b>Area number:</b> Repetition not allowed;<br />

  <br />
