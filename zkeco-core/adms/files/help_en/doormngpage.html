  <h2>Door settings</h2>
  Currently the system supports the connection and  control of up to 50 access control panels.<br />
    The access control system is primarily for the management of personnel forbidden and admission.<br />
	For security, a company will set personnel admission time zones, forbidden time zones and combinations of time zones.<br />
	For door opening verification, First-Card Normal Open, Multi-Card Opening, anti-passback, linkage, and interlock can be set to enhance security.<br />
	This system can provide real-time monitoring of doors and output of exception,  access control events and access level reports.<br />

  <br /><h3> Door management</h3><br />
  Click [Access control] - [Door configuration], and by  default it will access [Door management] interface, showing the list of all  control panels. When unfolded, it can show all doors under the control of the  control panel. Upon first entry into the access interface or successful query,  if currently the system has access control panels or the query result is not  null, by default it will unfold the doors of the first access control panel.  Click corresponding button for relevant parameter setting.<br /><br />

  <b>The fields are as follows:</b><br /><br />
  <b>Device name: </b>It is not editable (need to be edited in 6.2.1   Access control device);<br /><br />
  <b>Door number: </b>The system automatically name the numbers of  doors according to how many doors of the device (for example, the four doors of  a four-door control panel are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4). The number will be  consistent with the door number on the device.<br />
  <br /><b>Note: </b>Although by default the  number following the underline in the door name is consistent with the door  number, but 1/2/3/4   in anti-passback and interlock refers to door serial number  rather than the number following the door name, and they have no necessary relation,  and the system allows the user to modify the door name, so they can not be  confused;<br /><br />
  <b>Door name:</b> The default door name is “device name_door  number”. The field allows the user to modify as required. Up to 30 characters  can be entered;<br /><br />
  <b>Door valid time zone</b>, <b>door  normal open time zone</b>: By default either is null. Initialized and added  access control time zones will be shown for the user to select. Upon door  editing, door valid time zone is need to input. Only after setting door valid time  zone, the door can be opened and closely normally. We recommend to set door  normal open time period within the door valid time zone, only in this situation,  the door normal open time zone is valid;<br />
  <br /><b>Note: </b>Consecutive punching of a  card having access level of the door for 5 times can release the normal open  status within one day (including First-Card Normal Open), and close the door  immediately.<br /><br />
  <b>Lock drive duration:</b> Used to control the delay for unlocking  after card punching. The unit is second, and the default is 5 seconds. The user  can enter a number between 0-254;<br /><br />
  <b>Punch interval: </b>The unit is second (range: 0-10 seconds),  and the default is 2 seconds;<br /><br />
  <b>Door sensor type: </b>NO (door sensor not detected), Normal Open,  Normal Close. The default is NO. When editing doors, the user can select the  door sensor type to be Normal Open or Normal Close. If Normal Open or Normal  Close is selected, it is required to select <b>door status delay</b> and whether<b> close and reverse-lock </b>is required. By default, once door sensor type is  set as Normal Open or Normal Close, the default door status delay will be 15s,  and by default it will enable close and reverse-lock.<br />
  <b>Door status delay:</b> The duration for delayed detection of door  sensor after the door is opened. Detection is performed only after the door is  opened and the delay duration expired. When the door is not in the “Normally  Open” period, and the door is opened, the device will start timing. It will  trigger alarm when the delay duration expired, and stop alarm when you close  the door. The default door status delay will be 15s. The<b> door status delay </b>should be longer than<b> lock drive duration</b>.<br />
  <b>Close and reverse-lock: </b>Set locking or not after door closing. Tick  it for lock after door closing.<br />
  <b>Verify mode: </b>Supports Only Card and Password Plus Card  verify modes. The default is Only Card. When Password Plus Card mode is  selected, make sure the door uses a reader with keyboard;<br />
