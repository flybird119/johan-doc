    The system will, by default, show the monitoring of all  doors under the control panels within the current user’s access level. The user  can monitor one (or more) door(s) by [Area], [Control panel] or [Door].<br />
  <b>Open all current doors: </b>Open all doors currently shown;<br />
  <b>Close all current doors: </b>Close all doors currently shown.<br />

  <br />
 <br />Upon Door Status Monitoring, if the number of doors on  the current interface &lt;=64, the system will, by default, show the doors in  pictures to monitor door statuses. Once the number exceeds 64, the system will  automatically list the doors.<br /><br />
    When putting the cursor on a door, it will show  relevant parameters and operations: device, door number, door name, remote  opening, and remote closing. Icons in different colors represent statuses as  follows: <br />
  <table width="750" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="70px" align="left"><b><br />

  <br /><b>Event monitoring:</b><br /><br />
    The system automatically acquires monitored device  event records, including normal access control events and exceptional access  control events (including alarm events). Alarm events appear in red.  Exceptional events excluding alarm events appear in orange. Normal events  appear in green.<br /><br />
    Meanwhile, when an alarm event record appears on the  event monitoring interface, the “Find alarm event” prompt will appear on the  upper right corner. After the user clicks the link, the system will redirect to  the alarm event monitoring interface by opening a new window (or tab page).<br /><br />
    On the current event monitoring interface, the recent  records are on the top, enabling the user to see without dragging the  scrollbar. Meanwhile, the interface will show up to some 100 records.<br /><br />
    The list is shown below.<br />
  <div class="alignC"><img width="800" src="rtmonitorpage_clip_image008.jpg" /></div><br />
    Click [Find alarm event] on the upper right corner to  access [Alarm event] interface, and the user will see alarm events monitored in  [Event monitoring] before page turn and alarm events after the current time  point.<br /><br />
