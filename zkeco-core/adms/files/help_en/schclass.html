  <img width="716" height="508" src="schclass_clip_image002.jpg" /><br /><br />
  <b>Parameter setting is as  follows:</b><br /><br />
  <b>TimeTable name: </b>Any character, up to a combination of 30  characters;<br />
  <b>On-duty and off-duty time:</b> Format: HH: MM: SS;<br />
  <b>Allowed late minute and  allowed early leave minute: </b>Refers  to permitted duration of late or early leave against specified check-in and check-out  time;<br />
    For example: When setting allowed late minute to be 5,  if the check-in time is 9:00, person A checked in at 9:03, and person B at  9:06, then person A is not late, because his check-in time is not more than 5  minutes later than the check-in time, and person B is late for 6 minutes,  because his check-in time is more than 5 minutes later than the check-in time.<br />
  <b>Check-in required and  check-out required: </b>Whether  check-in and check-out are required on on-duty and off-duty time. If check-in/ check-out  is required, click the check box;<br />
  <b>Check-in/ check-out start and  end time: </b>The valid  check-in/ check-out duration must be entered, and check-in/check-out records  out of this range will be invalid. The check-out start and check-in end time  can not be overlapped. <br />
  <b>Calculated as workday:</b> Refers to the number of working days that  each shift is equal to. If a value is set here, the program will count working  days as the value. Otherwise, it will count as the setting in the attendance  rules;<br />
  <b>Break start and end time: </b>The system supports break in the format of  HH:MM:SS, and the break time will be deducted from the working duration for  attendance statistics;<br />
  <b>Work time: </b>Calculation of the minutes between the check-in  and check-out time set for this attendance timetable. The system does not  support automatic calculation.<br />
  <b>Whether delay calculated as  overtime:</b> Yes or No;<br />
  <b>The timetable contains fixed  overtime: </b>Meaning fixed  overtime contained in normal working duration. This setting normally useful  when the working shift is continuous at the shift changing situation.<br />
    For calculation of overtime, if “Yes” is selected for  Whether delay calculated as overtime, the overtime will be the delay (the interval  between check-out time and timetable end time) + the fixed overtime (minutes)  contained in the timebable. If “No” is selected for this item, that entry will  be 0.<br />
