  <h3>Multi-Card Opening</h3><br />
        Set levels for personnel in [Multi-Card Opening  Personnel Groups].<br /><br />
        This function needs to be enabled in some special  access occasions, where the door will open only after consecutive card punching  by several people. Before verifying, any card punching out of this combination  (even the card belong to other combination) will interrupt the procedure, and  you need to wait 10 seconds to restart verifying. It will not open upon card  punching by one of the combination.<br /><br />
        If currently [Multi-Card Opening Personnel Groups] is not  configured, the system will prompt, and the user can only add combination name.  The system permits the user to add a name-only combination, and to edit  Multi-Card Opening combination when [Multi-Card Opening Personnel Groups] is  added.<br /><br />
        Multi-Card Opening combination is a combination of the  personnel in one or more Multi-Card Opening Personnel Groups. When setting the  number of people in each group, you can configure one group (such as combined  door opening by two people in one group) or multiple groups (such as combined door  opening by four people, including 2 people in group 1 and 2 people in group 2),  and at least one group shall be entered a number of door opening people not  being 0, and meanwhile the total number of door opening people shall not be greater  than 5. In addition, if the number of people entered by the user is greater  than the number of people in the current group, the Multi-Card Opening function  will be unable to be realized normally.<br /><br />
