    Flexible shifts are the default attendance shifts of  the system, being the cycling of flexible timetables in a week. Flexible shifts  can be used for the scheduling of personnel with irregular working duration  subject to attendance records. When a person is not subject to scheduling but has  card punching records, flexible timetable will be used to calculate the  scheduling, and count as a type of overtime such as rest day overtime, holiday  overtime. Flexible shifts are suitable for entrepreneurs, business personnel,  service personnel and order-based production personnel, etc.<br />
    For example, if a personnel have flexible work time but  need to record the attendance, then flexible shift can be use by default. In  attendance statistics, it will show the check-in, check-out time, and count the  overtime by even card punches.<br /><br />
